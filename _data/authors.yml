    ## I am..
    My Korean name is SeongKyung Kim but mostly known as Irene. 
    Just like the diversity of the places I was brought up and studied at, which include Seattle, Oklahoma, San Diego, London, and Seoul, I am interested in diverse academic fields.
    I am enthusiastic about human emotions, abnormal and self-destructive behaviours, deep learning, NLP, computer vision, and game AI. 
    Although my interest covers broad areas it comes down to just one theme: **AI for vulnerable people**.
    My goal is to understand humans deeply to make human-centred machines to aid those who are in crisis (haven't exactly figured out which crisis though). 
    In short, I am a data scientist hoping to make the world a slightly better place to live...!
