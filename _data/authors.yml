    ## I am..
    My Korean name is SeongKyung Kim but mostly known as Irene. 
    
    Just like the diversity of the places I was brought up and studied at, which include Seattle, Oklahoma, San Diego, London, and Seoul, I am interested in diverse academic fields.
    I am enthusiastic about human emotions, abnormal and self-destructive behaviours, deep learning, NLP, computer vision, and game AI. 
    
    Although my interest covers broad areas it comes down to one theme: 
    <p style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold;color:steelblue">
     AI for vulnerable people
    </p>
    
    My goal is to deeply understand humans to make human-centred machines to aid those who are in need. 
    In short, I am a data scientist hoping to make the world a slightly better place to live...!
